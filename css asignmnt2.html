        My name is <i>Udoka Ineh</i> and I love technology because its an ever

        things, you meet lots of people and clients, not to mention the numerous
        opportunities that comes with it.

        So far, I have been introduced to <i>git, html and css</i>. I have also
        learnt how to structure a page using html, designed cards, voting table
        and more. Also we have been introduced to CSS, learnt its basis and
        cascading hierachy as well as its properties. CSS is important because
        its helps in styling a page hence making it aesthetically pleasing to
        the eyes.

        The difference between paddings, margins and borders is that paddings is
        the inner spaces between the content and the border of your box, and we
        have padding top, right,bottom and left. Margins is said to be the outer
        space of an element, just like padding, we also havgin top, right,
        bottom and left while border Border is the strip that goes around your
        div/element of the content. The CSS border properties (border-style,
        border-color, border-width and border-radius) are used to specify the
        style, color and size of the border.
